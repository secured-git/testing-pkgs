### **Step 1: Maven Setup and Compilation**  
1. **Developer defines dependencies in `pom.xml`** – The `pom.xml` file is the core of Maven's dependency management. The developer specifies required dependencies, such as:  
   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
           <version>3.1.0</version>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```
   Here, the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency is defined, allowing the Spring Boot application to support web functionalities.  

2. **Maven fetches all required dependencies** – Once dependencies are defined, running `mvn clean install` will automatically download required libraries (like Spring Boot, Lombok, Hibernate, etc.) from the Maven Central Repository and store them in the local repository (`.m2` folder).

3. **Maven Compiler compiles the Java code** – Maven compiles all Java classes and checks for errors. The compilation ensures that all dependencies and Java files work together correctly before running the application.

### **Step 2: Testing**  
4. **Developer runs tests using `mvn test`** – This command runs unit tests to verify that the code behaves as expected.  

5. **Maven Test executes unit and integration tests** – Maven automatically picks up test files (typically named `*Test.java`) and runs them.  
   Example of a simple unit test in Spring Boot:
   ```java
   @Test
   public void testServiceLayer() {
       assertEquals(5, someService.calculateSomething());
   }
   ```
   These tests ensure that components such as repositories, services, and controllers work properly before deployment.

### **Step 3: Packaging**  
6. **Developer runs `mvn package`** – After successful compilation and testing, the developer packages the application into a deployable artifact.  

7. **Maven Package creates a JAR/WAR file** – Based on the `pom.xml` configuration, Maven generates either:  
   - A **JAR file** (for standalone applications)  
   - A **WAR file** (for applications deployed in servlet containers like Tomcat)  

   Example: After running `mvn package`, the generated file might be:
   ```
   target/myapp-1.0.0.jar
   ```

---

### **Step 4: Deployment**  
8. **The JAR file is deployed to the server** – The packaged file is then deployed to a server such as:  
   - **AWS EC2** (using SSH and SCP commands to transfer and run the JAR)  
   - **Kubernetes** (by creating a Docker container and deploying via Helm)  
   - **Bare Metal Server** (running `java -jar myapp-1.0.0.jar`)  

   Example command to deploy on a Linux server:
   ```
   scp target/myapp-1.0.0.jar user@server:/opt/myapp/
   ssh user@server "java -jar /opt/myapp/myapp-1.0.0.jar"
   ```

### **Step 5: Frontend Build (Angular)**  
9. **Developer writes Angular code** – Angular components, services, and modules are written in TypeScript.  

10. **Angular components call services to fetch data** – A service makes API calls to the backend.  
    Example of an Angular service:
    ```typescript
    getData(): Observable<DataModel> {
        return this.http.get<DataModel>('http://backend-api.com/data');
    }
    ```
  
11. **Developer runs `ng build` to generate the frontend** – This creates a production-ready version of the application.  

12. **The `dist` folder is created, containing the compiled Angular app** – The build process optimizes code, removes unnecessary files, and stores everything in the `dist` folder.

---

### **Step 6: Connecting Angular to Backend**  
13. **Angular Service sends an API request, but first, it goes to Spring Security (Keycloak)** – Any request sent from Angular to the backend must go through authentication.  

14. **Keycloak checks authentication** – The backend verifies if the user is authenticated by validating a JWT (JSON Web Token).  

15. **If authentication is valid, Keycloak returns success** – If valid, Keycloak allows the request to proceed. Otherwise, it rejects unauthorized requests.  

16. **The request is then passed to the Spring REST Controller** – The controller handles the API request, for example:  
    ```java
    @GetMapping("/data")
    public ResponseEntity<Data> getData() {
        return ResponseEntity.ok(dataService.getData());
    }
    ```
  
17. **The controller calls the Service Layer to process business logic** – This layer contains core logic, such as data processing and validation.  

18. **The Service Layer calls the Repository Layer to fetch data** – The service interacts with the database layer via repositories.  

19. **Repository queries the Database for requested data** – This uses JPA/Hibernate to fetch records, for example:  
    ```java
    @Repository
    public interface DataRepository extends JpaRepository<Data, Long> { }
    ```
  
20. **Database returns the requested data** – The database responds with the queried records.  

21. **The data flows back up through the layers** – The repository sends data back to the service layer.  

22. **The response reaches the Spring Controller** – The controller prepares the data for an HTTP response.  

23. **The response is sent back to the Angular Service** – The API response is returned as JSON.  

24. **Angular Component updates the UI with the new data** – The component receives the data and updates the frontend dynamically.  

25. **The Developer (User) sees the updated data on the frontend** – The final data is displayed on the web page, completing the request-response cycle.
